# Social network analysis of Romance of the Three Kingdoms
## Description of the project
This project primarily aims to build the social network of the Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms using NLP technology, and then conduct quantitative analysis to verify existing literary theories. 
We begin with scraping text data from the Internet, then recognize the named entities (persons) and build the network according to the co-occurance of the characters. We analyse the constructed social network from three aspects: general information, comparison with the empiriacal networks and analysis for the main characters.
